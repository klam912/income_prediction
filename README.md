# Income Prediction 

## Goal: 
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model--logistic regression--that uses predictors, such as an individual's demographics(e.g. native country, age, occupation, net capital), to predict whether they make an income of over $50,000 or below.

## Tools:
• Data processing:
    • Pandas and Numpy
• Data visualization:
    • Matplotlib
• Data modeling:
    • Scikit-learn
• Version control:
    • Git and Github

## Result:
• Since this project is still ongoing, the results will be published soon so stay tune! 

## Limitation:
• TBD

## Data set source:
• This data set was obtained from UC Irvine's Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/2/adult)
